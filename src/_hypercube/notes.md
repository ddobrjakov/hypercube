* Logo rotations for instant moves. Instant moves.
* Different logo. Transparent logo.
---
### Refactoring
* Should probably be a method to get rotationMatrix for move (moves.js).
* Remove animation from hypercube.js.
* animateMoves should be more straightforward.
---
### Micro-adjustments
* Magic numbers in moves.js.
* Magic numbers in Cube Rotations (Orientations).
